# DartScript - Proof of Concept

This repository contains the initial Proof of Concept (PoC) for DartScript, a
project aiming to enable writing and executing Dart code directly within HTML,
similar to PyScript.

## Project Goal

Create a framework that allows developers to embed Dart code in HTML using tags
like `<dart-script>` and have it execute in the browser via WebAssembly,
enabling interaction with the DOM.

(See `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` for full details).

## Current Status (PoC)

This PoC demonstrates the core technical feasibility:

- Compiling simple Dart code to WASM (`dart compile wasm`).
- Loading and initializing the WASM module in a browser using a JavaScript
  loader (`js/loader.js`).
- Basic DOM manipulation from Dart, executed asynchronously after module
  initialization (`Timer.run`).

## How to Run the PoC

1. **Ensure Dart SDK is installed.**
2. **Activate `dhttpd`:**
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate dhttpd
   ```
3. **Serve the files:** Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal
   and run:
   ```bash
   dart pub global run dhttpd
   ```
4. **Open in browser:** Open the URL provided by `dhttpd` (usually
   `http://localhost:8080`) in your web browser.

You should see the heading "DartScript Proof of Concept" and the box below
should update with the message "Hello from Dart WASM! ðŸ‘‹ (Timer.run)". Check the
browser's developer console for additional logs.

## Next Steps

- Implement the `<dart-script>` tag handling mechanism.
- Develop more robust Dart APIs for browser interaction.
- Refine error handling.

directory according to the Memory Bank workflow.

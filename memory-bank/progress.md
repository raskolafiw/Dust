# DartScript Progress

## What Works (Foundational Elements)

- **Memory Bank Established:** Core documentation structure created and updated
  to reflect the new framework direction.
- **Core WASM Capabilities Proven (PoC):**
  - Basic Dart-to-WASM compilation (`dart compile wasm`).
  - WASM module loading via JavaScript (`main.mjs` helper).
  - Basic JS/WASM communication (JS loads WASM, invokes `main`).
- **Basic DOM Interaction Layer:**
  - JS functions (`window.dartScriptSetText`, etc.) created in `js/loader.js`.
  - Dart wrappers (`DartScriptApi`) created in `dart/main.dart`.
  - _This serves as a rudimentary basis for the future framework's DOM
    abstraction._
- **WASM Loading Mechanism:**
  - `js/loader.js` can load pre-compiled WASM modules.
  - _This mechanism will be adapted for loading the framework runtime and
    application bundle._

## What's Left to Build (High Level - Framework Focus)

- **Core Framework Implementation:**
  - **Component Model:** Design and implement the API for defining components
    (state, props, lifecycle).
  - **Rendering Engine:** Build the engine to translate component definitions
    into DOM operations (e.g., using Virtual DOM).
  - **State Management:** Develop or integrate basic state management solutions.
  - **Routing System:** Create a client-side router for SPA navigation.
  - **DOM Abstraction:** Refine `DartScriptApi` into a robust, type-safe DOM
    layer for the framework.
  - **Event Handling:** Implement a system for handling DOM events within Dart
    components.
- **Developer Experience Tooling:**
  - **Build System:** Develop a build process for development and production.
  - **Development Server:** Create a dev server, ideally with Hot Reload
    capabilities.
- **Documentation & Examples:** Create comprehensive documentation and usage
  examples for the framework.

## Current Status

- **Major Pivot Completed:** Project direction officially shifted from a simple
  script loader to building a full, modern Dart web framework inspired by
  React/Vue.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** All core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`,
  `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`,
  `techContext.md`) have been updated to reflect the new vision.
- **Foundational WASM Work Validated:** The initial PoC confirmed the viability
  of compiling Dart to WASM and basic JS interop.
- **Ready for Framework Design & Prototyping:** The next phase involves
  designing the core APIs (Component, Renderer) and building initial prototypes.

## Known Issues / Challenges

- **JS Interop Performance:** Calls across the JS/WASM boundary need careful
  optimization, especially for rendering.
- **`@JSExport` Limitations:** Direct JavaScript calls into Dart WASM remain
  problematic; the framework must rely on Dart initiating interactions via the
  JS bridge.
- **WASM Debugging:** Requires careful use of browser developer tools.
- **Bundle Size:** Managing the size of the compiled framework and application
  WASM will be crucial for performance.
- **Hot Reload Implementation:** Achieving efficient hot reload with WASM
  presents technical challenges.

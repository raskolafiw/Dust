# Dust Project Brief

## Core Goals

- **Create a Next-Generation Dart Web Framework:** Build a powerful and elegant
  web framework, inspired by React and Vue, designed to simplify and enhance the
  experience of building modern web applications with Dart.
- **Leverage Dart's Strengths:** Leverage Dart's strong typing, sound null
  safety, excellent performance (via WASM), and rich language features to
  provide a superior developer experience and runtime performance.
- **Component-Based & Declarative UI:** Provide a component-based architecture
  and a declarative UI paradigm, enabling developers to build reusable and
  maintainable user interfaces.
- **Seamless Developer Experience:** Aim for a developer workflow comparable to
  top JavaScript frameworks, including features like hot reload, state
  management, and build tooling.
- **(Potential) Full-Stack Capabilities:** Explore the possibility of leveraging
  Dart's cross-platform nature for code sharing and unified development across
  frontend and backend.
- **Built on WebAssembly:** Utilize WebAssembly technology for the Dart runtime
  environment, ensuring high performance and browser compatibility.

## Functional Goals

- **Core Runtime:** Efficient Dart runtime based on WASM.
- **Component Model:** Clear definition for component lifecycle, state, and
  props management.
- **Declarative Rendering Engine:** Efficiently map component state to DOM
  updates.
- **State Management Solution:** Provide built-in or recommended state
  management patterns.
- **Routing System:** Support Single Page Application (SPA) navigation.
- **DOM Abstraction Layer:** Provide a type-safe and easy-to-use DOM
  manipulation API.
- **Build & Dev Tools:** Integrated development server, build optimizations, and
  (ideally) hot reload support.
- **JS Interoperability:** Provide the ability to interact with existing
  JavaScript libraries and browser APIs.

## User Experience Goals

- **Developer-First:** Provide an intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable
  development experience.
- **Easy Onboarding:** Clear documentation and simple getting-started examples.
- **Performant Applications:** Enable developers to build fast and responsive
  web applications.
- **Scalability:** Framework design should support scaling from small projects
  to large applications.

## Technical Goals

- **Optimized WASM Performance:** Focus on WASM module size, loading time, and
  execution efficiency.
- **Efficient JS/WASM Bridge:** Implement low-overhead communication between
  Dart and JavaScript.
- **Type Safety:** Enforce Dart's type safety throughout the framework API.
- **Modularity & Testability:** Ensure the framework's internal structure is
  clear, modular, and easily testable.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensure stable operation on major modern
  browsers.

This revised brief reflects the ambition to create a comprehensive Dart web
framework, moving beyond the initial PyScript-like concept.
